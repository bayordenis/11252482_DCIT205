        <h3>Undergraduate Programs</h3>
        <p>
            Explore our undergraduate programs in Computer Science. These programs provide a solid foundation in computer science principles and prepare students for various careers in the field.
            The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.

        </p>

        <h3>Graduate Programs</h3>
        <br>
            Learn about our graduate programs, including Master's and Ph.D. programs. Our graduate programs offer advanced studies in specialized areas of computer science and opportunities for research.

            This course will introduce students to a number of highly efficient algorithms and data structures for fundamental computational problems such as primality testing, linear optimisation and string matching.
             Other topics will include, design and analysis of algorithms, data types, trees, operations on sets, advance set representation methods, directed graphs, undirected graphs, sorting, algorithm analysis techniques, algorithm design techniques, data structures and algorithms for external storage as well as memory management.
              In addition students are introduced to randomised algorithms and to techniques of amortised complexity analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                As indicated on the homepage, the department also offers online short courses described below.
