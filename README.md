<b>COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT WEBSITE REDESIGN</b>

PROJECT OVERVIEW</br>
This project involves the creation of a 10-page website for the Computer Science Department of University of Ghana, emphasizing the practical application of web development skills and showcasing an understanding of computer science resources. The goal is not to replicate the existing CS website but to enhance it by adding new features or implementing a redesign. The project is limited to the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

HOW TO CLONE AND SET UP THE PROJECT</br>
In the realm of web development, creating a robust and visually appealing website for the Computer Science Department demands a strategic approach that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to clone, set up, and improve the existing website, showcasing advanced features or a redesigned interface.
Begin by cloning the repository using the git clone <repository-url> command, placing it in your desired directory. Once inside the project folder, install the necessary dependencies with npm install. Launch the development server using npm start and access the site locally at http://localhost:3000.
Next, open your preferred code editor to edit and customize the HTML, CSS, Javascript and React components. Implement your redesign or introduce new features while ensuring thorough testing to validate functionality. To prepare for production, execute npm run build and deploy the contents of the build folder to your chosen hosting platform.
For version control, consider committing your changes and pushing them to your repository with git add ., git commit -m "Improved Computer Science Department website", and git push origin main. Now the project is being cloned and set up.
Summarized steps:
.Open a command prompt and give the following commands</br>
.git init</br>
.git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git</br>
.git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/example/repo.git new_directory</br>
.git checkout -b feature-branch</br>
.git add .</br>
.git commit -m "Initial commit"</br>
.git push origin main branch</br>

WHAT I HAVE LEARNT FROM THE PROJECT</br>
Developing the enhanced Computer Science Department website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React has been a valuable learning experience. This project deepened my understanding of front-end technologies, allowing me to seamlessly integrate dynamic features and responsive design principles. The project emphasized the significance of user experience, prompting me to prioritize accessibility and usability in the redesign or feature additions. Additionally, deploying the website and managing version control highlighted the importance of efficient workflows and collaboration. Overall, this project has enriched my proficiency in web development, providing hands-on experience in creating functional, aesthetically pleasing websites while navigating the complexities of modern front-end frameworks.I am now formiliar with most of the technical terms that were being mention in class and those I came across in my personal studies.
